# ansible-mssql-callback
Ansible Callback plugin to log Playbook runs in a MS SQL database

This callback plugin is based on https://github.com/sipgate/ansible-logger but has been deeply modified due to changes in Callback plugins schema after Ansible 2.X, and of course because we ar using MS SQL as database backend.

Absolutely no warranty to work. Just for fun.
